          Emotions at Play: Designing AI &amp; Tangible Tools for Children’s Emotional Learning

          A participatory UX research and design project exploring how AI and tangible play can foster emotional
          intelligence in children. I led the full design cycle — from generative research and facilitated
          co-design sessions with 27 children (ages 6–12), to interaction design in Figma, prototyping an
          AI-powered “feel-better sticker” tool, and testing it iteratively with real users.

  <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 border-b border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-neutral-900">Problem Statement</h2>

    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-6 text-neutral-700">
      <li>
        <strong>State of the world:</strong><br/>
        Children today are navigating anxiety, loneliness, and social pressure in increasingly digital worlds. Shifts in socialization,
        limited unstructured peer time, and post-pandemic caution from adults have reduced the spaces where kids naturally learn
        empathy, negotiation, and emotional regulation through everyday play. Researchers and global health orgs warn that children's
        emotional well-being is in crisis, with growing stress and fewer safe opportunities to “practice feelings together”
        in low-stakes settings. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>The big BUT:</strong><br/>
        Many tools meant to “teach emotions” are adult-scripted, corrective, and individual. Kids are told to identify
        the “right” feeling word and calm down. What’s missing is a model of emotional learning that is child-led, social,
        and playful — where children can experiment with feelings, laugh about mistakes, and discover that
        <em>“I am not the only one who felt this.”</em> Existing work in AI and emotion mostly focuses on specialized interventions
        or structured skill training, not everyday emotional co-creation between peers. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Therefore, we did:</strong><br/>
        We designed and evaluated a hybrid system — tangible games plus an AI-powered “feel-better sticker” tool — to explore how
        children express, share, and reinterpret emotions together. Our research goal was to ask:<br/>
        <span class="italic">
          Can we design playful tools (both physical and AI-driven) that act like a campfire — a shared place where kids gather,
          tell real stories, trade emotional artifacts, and build empathy together?
        </span> 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="mt-8 bg-neutral-100 border border-neutral-200 rounded-xl p-4 text-sm text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
      <div class="font-semibold text-neutral-900 text-sm mb-1">Research Goal</div>
      Use participatory design with children to:<br/>
      (1) understand how they already express and negotiate difficult feelings through play,<br/>
      (2) translate those behaviors into design requirements, and<br/>
      (3) build/test an AI-assisted prototype that supports <strong>peer empathy</strong> — not just self-regulation.

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
      <div class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before making anything, I did foundational work: reviewing prior HCI and learning sciences research,
          interviewing facilitators who work with children, and mapping typical emotional “failure points”
          (conflict with peers, being embarrassed in public, fear of “getting in trouble” for reacting).
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          The literature is clear: kids learn emotional negotiation not by being told how to feel,
          but by <em>trying it out socially</em> — through role-play, storytelling, inside jokes, and bending rules with peers.
          These are rehearsal spaces where children practice self-regulation, test boundaries, and learn empathy in real time. 
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 italic text-neutral-800">
          My early hypothesis: If we want to design for children’s emotional lives, we have to design
          for the space between children — not just inside the child.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          That belief became the backbone of this work and shaped every UX decision I made afterward:
          language tone, interaction pacing, even why the final tool produces <em>stickers you can hold</em>
          instead of a score or a report card.

      <div class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
        <h3 class="font-medium text-neutral-900 mb-2">PD1 · Storytelling Dice</h3>
        <p>
          We created large “emotion dice” inspired by Pixar’s <em>Inside Out</em>. Each roll surfaced an emotion
          (anger, fear, disgust, embarrassment, sadness), and kids then told a real story about that feeling.
          They drew scenes, acted them out, and turned discomfort into something performable and funny.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
          Children repeatedly chose what adults would call “negative” emotions — and they loved it.
          One callback from the session: a participant gleefully explained that disgust was their favorite emotion
          because “she’s dramatic and it’s fun to talk like her.” From a UX lens, this matters:
          it shows emotional safety emerging not from calmness, but from performative exaggeration.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-medium text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-2">PD2 · Empathy Game (“You Are Not Alone”)</h3>
        <p>
          In the second session, kids co-designed empathy games in small groups. Each game started with someone sharing
          a real stress moment — “I was nervous before public speaking” — and other players signaling if they had felt
          the same, sometimes by jumping, spinning, or shouting a silly safe word. 
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
          What happened in those groups was important: empathy wasn’t delivered as “I’m sorry you went through that.”
          It sounded more like “Same. I felt that too. You’re not weird.”
          That is peer validation, not adult validation. That is the social glue.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 italic text-neutral-800">
          My reflection:<br/>
          Across PD1 and PD2, kids kept making and holding little artifacts — sketches of moments, token cards,
          even emotions-as-characters. They started treating these as emotional badges. That behavior led directly
          to the next design move: could we make a tool whose main output is a <strong>custom emotional artifact</strong>
          they can keep, trade, or gift?
        </p>
      </div>

        <p class="text-sm text-neutral-500 mt-2">
          Children reframed difficult emotions through play, humor, rule-bending, and shared storytelling —
          not through calm disclosure.

        <p>
          After PD1 and PD2, we had a sharp design requirement:

        <div class="bg-neutral-100 border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg p-4 text-neutral-800 text-sm mt-4">
          <strong>Design requirement:</strong><br/>
          Give kids a playful, visual artifact that says “this is how I felt,” that they can
          edit, laugh at, hand to a peer, or keep for themselves — without an adult translating it.
        </div>

        <p class="mt-6">
          In synthesis, three recurring qualities described how children were already doing “emotional work”
          for themselves and each other:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> – Kids probed tough feelings through experimentation and rule-bending:
              “What if anger could be a game?” </li>

          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Ownership</strong> – They insisted on controlling the framing of their own emotions,
              inventing characters, changing the rules of the game, and defending their choices in front of peers. </li>

          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Enjoyment</strong> – Laughter and silliness made vulnerability feel safe. Kids stayed engaged
              because it felt fun, not because we asked them to “open up.” </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-6 italic text-neutral-800">
          I formalized these three as evaluation pillars for every prototype that followed.  
          This is where my teaching brain kicked in: I began treating “curiosity, ownership, enjoyment”
          as a rubric for emotionally intelligent UX.

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
      <div class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I developed the core interaction concept: the <strong>AI Emotional Sticker Tool</strong>.
          The idea was to let a child:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <li>Tell a short story about when they felt something intense (angry, scared, embarrassed, sad).</li>
          <li>Generate a “feel-better” sticker — an image + message — using AI.</li>
          <li>Remix that sticker for themself or gift it to a peer: “Here’s how I see your feeling.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-6">
          This model treats AI not as an authority that diagnoses emotion, but as a creative assistant that
          produces a starting point. When the AI message felt off, kids openly mocked it:
          “That’s weird. I wouldn’t say that.” Instead of shutting down, they laughed together,
          and then rewrote it. That critique itself became emotional reflection. 
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 italic text-neutral-800">
          As a designer, this was a turning point: I stopped chasing “perfect” AI empathy.  
          I started designing for editable AI — AI that invites children to disagree and improve it.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6">
          I call this the <strong>Campfire Model</strong>: the tool sits in the middle like a shared fire, generating sparks
          (stickers, jokes, mini characters), and kids gather around it, reacting, negotiating, co-authoring.
          The important thing isn’t that the tool is “right.” The important thing is that it keeps the circle together.

      As the design matured, I deliberately pulled away from a “teacher voice.”  
      Children mistrusted anything that sounded like moral guidance (“You should calm down”).  
      They preferred messages that felt like a caring peer or a funny character.
      This is where my design philosophy around <strong>tone-as-safety</strong> really solidified.

      <div class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          We tested both “self-stickers” (you generate a sticker for your own story) and “peer-stickers”
          (you generate a sticker for someone else’s story). Children then compared versions:
          “How I described my feeling” vs “How you described my feeling.”
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          That comparison created powerful dialogue. Kids corrected each other gently:
          <span class="italic">“I wasn’t mad, I was scared.”</span><br/>
          Emotional misreadings actually became productive, because the artifact — the sticker — sat in the middle.
          No one had to directly accuse anyone. They could just point and say,
          <span class="italic">“That’s not really me.”</span>
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          They also critiqued the AI fearlessly, which was great. We heard:
          <span class="italic">“The AI’s message is weird.”</span>  
          <span class="italic">“Message needs to be improved.”</span>  
          <span class="italic">“I want it to be slow.”</span> 
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 italic text-neutral-800">
          My reflection as a designer:<br/>
          Children didn’t want “perfect” empathy from AI.  
          They wanted editable empathy.  
          That’s a huge design lesson for child-facing AI.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Finally, kids loved the physicality. One participant said they liked the sticker because
          “it was cute … it makes me feel happy,” especially if it had a friendly animal character. 
          Tangibility gave them ownership. They could hold their feelings.

          Humor and even “AI being wrong” created a low-risk social buffer, which made emotional talk possible.  
          The AI became a safe third party.

  <!-- CONCLUSION / IMPACT -->
  <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-neutral-900">Conclusion · What I Learned &amp; Design Guidance</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
      This work argues for a shift in how we design “emotional support” for children:  
      instead of focusing on diagnosis (“name the feeling, fix the feeling”), we should design <strong>campfire experiences</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      The campfire model treats technology as the warm center of a circle: it generates artifacts (stickers, characters, shared jokes)
      that kids can gather around. Because the artifact sits in the middle, no one child is “on the spot.”
      The tool becomes the thing everyone looks at, critiques, laughs with — and that makes difficult emotions safe to talk about.
      
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
      <li><strong>Curiosity</strong><br/>
        When activities invited experimentation — rolling weird emotion dice, regenerating AI stickers “just to see” — kids leaned in.
        Curiosity was the on-ramp. 
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><strong>Ownership</strong><br/>
        Children wanted to control how their feelings were represented. They bent rules, rewrote sticker messages,
        and defended “their version” of the story in front of peers. Ownership built pride and safety. 
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><strong>Enjoyment</strong><br/>
        Fun wasn’t just entertainment — it actively turned embarrassment and fear into something survivable, even joyful.
        Humor made emotional honesty sustainable. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
      For me as a UX researcher, designer, and educator, this project crystallized a core belief:
      <span class="italic">
        emotionally intelligent design is not about delivering the “right” message — it’s about creating social,
        modifiable artifacts that people can gather around.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      For teaching, I now use this work to guide students through:
      <strong>participatory methods with vulnerable users,</strong>
      <strong>ethical AI as a collaborator (not authority),</strong>
      and <strong>tangible takeaways</strong> that travel beyond the interface (printable stickers, objects kids keep).
      In other words: design for after the session.

      Outcome: This work is submitted to CHI 2026 as “Emotions at Play: Children’s Emotional Learning with AI and Tangible Tools.”  
      Design implication: Emotional UX for children must prioritize tangible artifacts, flexible authorship, and collective meaning-making.
