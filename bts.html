      Emotions at Play: Designing Child-Centered AI for Emotional Support
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-neutral-700 mt-4 max-w-3xl">
      I led the end-to-end design of a playful emotional support tool for children (ages 6–12).
      The product combines physical play, peer empathy, and an AI-powered “feel-better sticker” generator.
      This case study shows my UX process: how I scoped the problem, co-designed with real users,
      built and tested prototypes in Figma and code, and iterated on interaction patterns for emotional safety.

  <!-- 1. DISCOVERY / PROBLEM DEFINITION -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">1. Discovery · Why this product needs to exist</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      Children are experiencing more stress, anxiety, and loneliness, but they’re getting fewer natural opportunities
      to practice empathy, negotiate conflict, or talk about feelings with peers. A lot of what’s called “emotional learning”
      today is adult-scripted (“tell me how you feel”) or compliance-based (“use the correct emotion word”). That model
      doesn’t reflect how kids actually express emotion in their lives. 
    </p>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 mt-4">
      My design question was:
    </p>
    <p class="bg-white border border-neutral-300 rounded-lg p-4 text-neutral-900 font-medium text-lg leading-relaxed">
      How might we create an experience where kids can safely express hard feelings,
      see they’re not alone, and feel supported — without making it feel like therapy or school?
    </p>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">What I did in this phase</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li>Background scan of child emotional development and play-based learning.</li>
        <li>Identified a gap: almost no tools let kids co-create emotional meaning with each other using both physical and digital media. </li>
        <li>Defined initial concept: a “play first, feelings second” journey instead of “label your feelings.”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Why this matters for UX</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        This is where pedagogy meets product. I’m not only studying kids; I’m modeling an experience architecture for
        emotionally sensitive users. This is the same mindset I would teach in a UX classroom: problem framing before solution making.

  <!-- 2. USER RESEARCH / PARTICIPATORY SESSIONS -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">2. Generative Research with Users</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      I ran four participatory design sessions (“PD1–PD4”) with 27 children (ages 6–12). Each session was both
      a research probe and a design sprint. Instead of treating kids as “testers,” I treated them as co-designers.
      This gave me authentic behavioral data and immediate design direction. 
    </p>

    <div class="mt-6 bg-white border border-neutral-200 rounded-xl p-5">
      <p class="text-neutral-500 font-medium text-xs uppercase tracking-wide">Participants and Methods</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li>27 children (6–12 years old), mixed backgrounds, gender-balanced. Sessions held in small groups to support peer comfort. </li>
        <li>Data sources: video recordings, facilitator notes, artifacts made by the kids (drawings, stickers, game prototypes). </li>
        <li>Analysis: iterative coding in Atlas.ti; I led synthesis and theme development across sessions. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">What I learned in this phase</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li>Kids don’t start with “I’m sad.” They start with humor, exaggeration, performance. This tells us how the UI tone should sound.</li>
        <li>They feel safer when emotions are made into a shared activity, not an interview.</li>
        <li>They prefer tangible, modifiable objects (dice, cards, stickers) over static screens. That led me toward hybrid physical-digital design. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-6">
      These insights drove the next step: instead of jumping straight into a slick high-fidelity app, I intentionally prototyped
      <strong>experiences</strong> first (storytelling games, empathy games) before prototyping <strong>interfaces</strong>.
      That sequencing was strategic and user-driven.
    </p>
  </section>


  <!-- 3. EXPERIENCE PROTOTYPE 1 · EMOTION STORYTELLING -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">3. Prototype Sprint 1 · Emotional Storytelling with Dice (PD1)</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      I created giant “Inside Out”–style emotion dice and story cards. Kids rolled an emotion (anger, disgust, fear, etc.),
      told a story from their life that matched it, and drew it on large sticker sheets. 
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li>Goal: Test whether play can get kids to surface authentic emotions voluntarily.</li>
      <li>Observation: Many kids said they <em>prefer</em> “negative” emotions because they’re more dramatic and funny (“My favorite emotion is disgust”). </li>
      <li>Unexpected behavior: They modified the rules mid-activity to make it sillier (“inconvenience equals funny”), which increased sharing. </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Design decision coming out of this sprint</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        Because humor made space for vulnerability, I realized the interface later cannot be clinical or overly “supportive teacher.”
        It has to sound like a playful collaborator. This insight shaped copy tone in my later Figma flows.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- 4. EXPERIENCE PROTOTYPE 2 · EMPATHY GAME DESIGN -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">4. Prototype Sprint 2 · Empathy Game Co-Design (PD2)</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      Next, I facilitated “You Are Not Alone,” where children designed their own empathy games using cards, spinners, Jenga blocks,
      and challenges. They shared a real stress moment (ex: “I was nervous before public speaking”), and other players who had felt
      the same had to perform an action. 
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li>Goal: See how kids build empathy with each other.</li>
      <li>Finding: Empathy was not “I imagine how you feel.” It was “Oh, me too.” That’s a totally different UX model.</li>
      <li>Social dynamic: Kids were motivated by recognition and belonging, not moral instruction.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Design decision coming out of this sprint</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        The product shouldn’t only reflect <em>your</em> feeling back to you. It should also show: “Other kids have felt this, too.”
        That directly inspired the next phase: designing a tool that can generate visual, sharable comfort objects.

  <!-- 5. DIGITAL PRODUCT CONCEPT · AI FEEL-BETTER STICKER -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">5. Product Concept · AI ‘Feel-Better Sticker’ Generator (PD3)</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      At this point I moved from physical/social prototyping into an actual digital product concept.
      I designed the first version of the AI Sticker Tool in Figma
      (<a href="https://www.figma.com/design/EpB6TTLzJL5b0cq3SniULK/Education-AI-sticker-prototype?node-id=0-1&p=f"

      <p class="text-neutral-500 font-medium text-xs uppercase tracking-wide">Core Flow (v1 wireframe)</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li><strong>Tell Your Story:</strong> Child uploads a quick drawing of “what happened” and picks how they feel (sad / angry / scared / worried / lonely).</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Support:</strong> The tool generates a sticker illustration + a short “feel-better” message + a simple reflection (“It’s okay to feel angry when…”).</li>
        <li><strong>Print & Keep:</strong> The child can print the stickers, decorate them, trade them, or keep them in personal spaces. </li>
      </ol>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">What I was testing in this prototype</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li>Does the language feel safe / supportive / non-patronizing?</li>
        <li>Do kids understand what the AI is doing with their input (transparency)?</li>
        <li>Do they care about accuracy, or do they care about cuteness / ownership?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">What I learned from user testing</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li>Kids <em>loved</em> getting a physical artifact that represented their feeling. They wanted to take it home, decorate it, and show it. </li>
        <li>They immediately mocked generic AI messages (“AI didn’t listen to me”, “That sounds corny”). This critique was social and funny, not hostile. </li>
        <li>They wanted control: “Can I change the words?” “Can you make it cuter?” That told me this tool must be <strong>editable, not prescriptive</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Design decision for next iteration</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        I updated the interaction model to treat AI output as a draft to personalize — not “the answer.”
        In other words: AI as a co-creator the child can push back on.
        Pedagogically, that gives the child agency.
        UX-wise, that prevents the tool from sounding like a fake therapist.

  <!-- 6. COLLABORATIVE INTERPRETATION · PEER-GENERATED STICKERS -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">6. Peer Interpretation Layer (PD4)</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      In the next sprint, I extended the concept: instead of making a sticker for yourself, you make one for a friend.
      Each child listened to another child’s story, then used the tool to generate a sticker meant to comfort that peer.
      Finally, they compared: “How I see me” vs “How you see me.”
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li>Goal: Can this product help children practice empathy?</li>
      <li>Result: Kids started talking about emotional accuracy (“That’s not how I felt”) and emotional misreading (“You thought I was mad, but I was scared”).</li>
      <li>Bonus: Disagreement itself became learning. They laughed together when AI or a peer “got it wrong,” which actually opened space to clarify feelings. </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Why this matters for UX</p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        The product is no longer just self-soothing. It’s now mediating a social interaction and helping children articulate
        differences in interpretation. That’s a core collaborative UX pattern: shared artifact → shared reflection.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">7. Interface & Technical Design</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      I designed the AI Sticker Tool as a lightweight web app. The interaction model visible in Figma includes three core screens:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-white border border-neutral-200 rounded-xl p-5 mt-6">
      <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <li><strong>Story Input Screen</strong><br/>
          Upload drawing → Select feeling → Type “what happened.”  
          <span class="text-neutral-500 text-xs block mt-1">Design focus: gentle prompting, not interrogation.</span>
        </li>

        <li class="mt-4"><strong>AI Preview Screen</strong><br/>
          Displays generated sticker art + supportive message + short emotional reflection.  
          <span class="text-neutral-500 text-xs block mt-1">Design focus: give the child OPTIONS (“Regenerate,” “Make it cuter,” “Change message”).</span>
        </li>

        <li class="mt-4"><strong>Print & Personalize Screen</strong><br/>
          Outputs a printable sticker sheet the child can physically cut, keep, or gift.  
          <span class="text-neutral-500 text-xs block mt-1">Design focus: ownership, portability, and pride of creation.</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-6">
      From a technical mentorship perspective (what I’d teach students):  
      we are not just “using AI.” We are shaping:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li><strong>Prompt framing</strong> so the model reflects feelings without judgmental tone.</li>
      <li><strong>Child-safe language and guardrails</strong> (“It’s okay to feel angry when…” vs “You should calm down”).</li>
      <li><strong>Editable output</strong> so the child stays in control and the AI is positioned as a creative assistant, not an authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-6">
      That human/AI relationship design is crucial in youth-facing products, and it’s an area I specialize in and can bring into curriculum.

  <!-- 8. FINAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES / WHAT I TEACH -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">8. Final Design Principles</h2>

    <p class="text-neutral-700">
      By the end of this iterative process, three principles consistently guided my design decisions:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li><strong>1. Curiosity before compliance.</strong><br/>
        Kids leaned into emotions when they were framed as playful, not evaluative. Surprise and randomness (dice, AI variations)
        invite exploration. 
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><strong>2. Ownership over prescription.</strong><br/>
        Children wanted to control the message, the visuals, and even the rules. Tools should offer editable, personalizable outputs,
        not “final answers.” 
      </li>

      <li class="mt-4"><strong>3. Social reflection, not solo self-regulation.</strong><br/>
        The emotional value came from peer recognition (“me too”), shared laughter, and even disagreement.
        UX for kids should create moments of co-experience, not isolate them. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-6">
      These principles became my rubric for evaluating new features. They’re also the lenses I bring when I mentor students:
      usability and accessibility are necessary, but in emotionally sensitive work, <strong>relational experience design</strong> is just as critical.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
      <li>27 children co-created emotional artifacts (stickers, rules, games) they felt proud of and took home, extending reflection beyond the session. </li>
      <li>The iterative process revealed how AI can act as a “third object” that kids can safely critique together, rather than as an authority. </li>
      <li>The work produced a design framework (curiosity · ownership · enjoyment) that I now use to guide emotionally aware interaction design.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-neutral-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-6">
      Practically: this work has informed how I teach user research, prototyping with vulnerable populations, and responsible AI for youth.
      It also demonstrates my ability to lead research-driven UX projects from discovery to functional prototypes with real users.
