  <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
  <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Problem Statement</h2>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4">
      <li><strong>State of the World:</strong>  
        Play is a natural foundation for children’s emotional growth. Studies show that when children build stories, games, or characters, 
        they externalize emotions, negotiate meaning, and develop empathy:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
        Yet digital emotional-learning tools often remain adult-centered, focusing on structured skill training instead of spontaneous, child-led exploration.
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Big BUT:</strong>  
        Despite evidence that play transforms difficult emotions into manageable experiences, 
        there is little research on how children themselves use playful and technological tools to express and reinterpret emotions collectively.
        This gap limits how we design emotionally intelligent systems for youth in an age of pervasive AI and screen time.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Therefore, We Did:</strong>  
        This study explored how children engage with <strong>AI-assisted and tangible tools</strong> to express, share, and reinterpret emotions through play.  
        The goal was to design and evaluate the <em>AI Emotional Sticker Tool</em> — a hybrid interface that combines storytelling, empathy games, and AI image generation — 
        to understand how technology can serve as a <strong>campfire for emotional learning</strong>.

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 items-start">
      <div>
        <p>
          My UX philosophy emphasizes <strong>emotional intelligence, participatory design, and play</strong> as drivers of creativity and empathy.
          Grounded in sociocultural theory and constructivism, I view children not as end-users but as co-designers who bring emotional insight into the design process.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The goal was not only to design for emotional learning, but to design <em>through</em> it—creating tools that spark curiosity, agency, and shared reflection.
          This project treats technology, especially AI, as a <strong>reflective partner</strong> rather than an evaluator.

        <p>
          Using dice inspired by Pixar’s <em>Inside Out</em>, children created stories around emotions such as anger, sadness, or joy.
          The activity revealed that difficult emotions were often the most fun to explore — curiosity became a gateway for emotional expression:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-medium text-lg mt-6 mb-2">PD2 · Empathy Game Design</h3>
        <p>
          Children co-designed empathy games (“You Are Not Alone”) using cards, dice, and wheels.  
          By recognizing shared emotions, they turned vulnerability into social play, discovering that <strong>stickers</strong> and 
          visual tokens were their favorite medium for expressing and sharing feelings:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

        <p class="mt-4 italic text-sm text-neutral-700">

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 border-t border-neutral-200">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion · Campfire Model & Playful Learning</h2>
    <p>
      This project shows that emotional learning happens most effectively around shared, playful artifacts — what I call the
      <strong>Campfire Model of Emotional Design</strong>. Like a campfire, these tools draw children together to share stories, 
      laugh, and reinterpret emotions collectively:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-neutral-700">
      <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> – Playful uncertainty (dice, AI randomness) sparks emotional exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership</strong> – Children co-create and adapt rules, claiming voice and authorship:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoyment</strong> – Humor transforms vulnerability into connection and empathy:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-6">
      Together, these principles frame <strong>Playful Learning for Emotional UX</strong> — where emotional design is not about teaching 
      correct feelings, but about cultivating environments that make emotions visible, social, and fun to explore.
